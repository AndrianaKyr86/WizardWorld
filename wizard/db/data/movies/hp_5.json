  "summary": "Harry’s fifth year at Hogwarts is no short of trouble when a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge, is appointed by the ministry of magic. Umbridge refuses to teach any actual defensive spells, causing Harry to form a secret group of students called “Dumbledore’s Army” to learn and teach defensive spells. The connection between Harry and Voldemort’s mind grows stronger, and a concerned Dumbledore asks Snape to teach Occlumency to Harry. Harry experiences a surge of romantic feelings for someone. Things only get worse as Dumbledore’s Army is discovered and Umbridge is appointed as the new Headmistress. As Voldemort grows in power and the danger grows ever more, Harry might lose someone very close to him.",
